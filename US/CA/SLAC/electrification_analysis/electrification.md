To configure the model use file `electrification_analayis_config.csv`.
The types of variables defined in the file are: 
- Day and time of the simulation
- Weather and season of the simulation
- Floor area of the house simulation
- Insulation levels of house simulation
- Solar capacity and battery capacity
- Load preference of the study is implicit

Appliances that can defined as gas are: Clothes Dryer, Waterheater, Heating, Stove/Range. If the house is defined to use gas as fuel, the model assumes all the aforementioned appliances are gas.
